BASICS OF GIT - HUB (VS-CODE): 

1.  M - changes
2.  U- undefined
3.  we need to use commit (with name) & then commit & then we need to select to 'main' branch as all main codes are here 
4.  we can change the branch by '> rename branch' & then we need to link our git-hub and add a repo
5.  then we need to pull from #repo link
6.  then push to #repo link
